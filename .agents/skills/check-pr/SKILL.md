# Check PR

Analyze a pull request for review comments, status checks, and description completeness, then help address any issues found.

## Inputs

- **PR number** (optional): If not provided, detect the PR for the current branch.

## Instructions

### 1. Identify the PR

If a PR number was provided, use it. Otherwise, detect it:

```bash
gh pr view --json number -q .number
```

### 2. Fetch PR details

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,state,reviews,comments,headRefName,statusCheckRollup
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments
```

### 3. Wait for pending checks

Before analyzing, ensure all status checks have completed. If any checks are `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`, poll every 30 seconds until all checks reach a terminal state (success or failure). This ensures that review bot comments (Greptile, linters, etc.) are available before analysis.

### 4. Analyze the PR

Once all checks are complete, evaluate these areas:

#### A. Status Checks

- Are all CI checks passing?
- If any are failing, identify which ones and the failure reason.

#### B. PR Description

- Is the description complete and follows team conventions?
- Are all required sections filled in?
- Are there TODOs or placeholders that need updating?

#### C. Review Comments

- Inline code review comments that need addressing
- Look for bot review comments (e.g. from `greptile-apps[bot]`, linters, etc.)
- Human reviewer comments

#### D. General Comments

- Discussion comments on the PR
- Bot comments (Vercel deploy previews, etc.) — usually informational

### 5. Categorize issues

For each issue found, categorize as:

| Category              | Meaning                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Actionable**        | Code changes, test improvements, or fixes needed                  |
| **Informational**     | Verification notes, questions, or FYIs that don't require changes |
| **Already addressed** | Issues that appear to be resolved by subsequent commits           |

### 6. Report findings

Present a summary table:

| Area          | Issue                         | Status        | Action Needed                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Status Checks | CI build failing              | Failing       | Fix type error in `src/api.ts` |
| Review        | "Add null check" — @reviewer  | Actionable    | Add guard clause               |
| Description   | TODO placeholder in test plan | Actionable    | Fill in test plan              |
| Review        | "Looks good" — @teammate      | Informational | None                           |

### 7. Fix issues (if requested)

If there are actionable items:

1. Switch to the PR's branch if not already on it.
2. Ask the user if they want to fix the issues.
3. If yes, make the fixes, commit, and push.

### 8. Resolve review threads

After addressing comments, resolve the corresponding review threads.

First, fetch unresolved thread IDs (paginate if needed — see [the GraphQL reference](references/graphql-queries.md)):

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($cursor: String) {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100, after: $cursor) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes { body path }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

If `hasNextPage` is true, repeat with `-f cursor=ENDCURSOR` to get remaining threads.

Then resolve threads that have been addressed or are informational:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_ID"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

Batch multiple resolutions into a single mutation using aliases (`t1`, `t2`, etc.).

### 9. Multiple PRs

If checking a chain of PRs, process them sequentially.

## Output format

Summarize:

- PR title and current state
- Status checks summary (passing/failing/pending)
- Total issues found
- Actionable items with descriptions
- Items that can be ignored with reasons
- Recommended next steps
