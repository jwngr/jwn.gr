The lifecycle of a developer's personal website is a reflection of the ever-evolving landscape of
web technologies. Mine is no exception, having gone from humble HTML and CSS beginnings through
Create React App and eventually landing on Gatsby. However, Gatsby has shown its age and I found
myself seeking a modern alternative. Enter [Astro](https://astro.build/) — a framework that has
breathed some new life into this site.

## Catalysts for change

My decision to redesign wasn't just about using a new framework. I had specific goals in mind:

1. **Create a dedicated writing space:** I wanted a platform fully under my control for showcasing
   my ideas.
2. **Reduce maintenance overhead:** My Gatsby site had become a burden. I couldn't build the site
   locally or upgrade dependencies, leaving it outdated since 2019.
3. **Make the design feel more professional:** I wanted a cleaner, simpler look that reflected my
   growth as a developer and designer.

## The transformation

Before diving into the technical details, let's look at the visual transformation:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-template-rows: auto auto; gap: 8px 20px;">
  <h5 style="text-align: center;">
    <b>Old site design</b>
  </h5>
  <h5 style="text-align: center;">
    <b>New site design</b>
  </h5>
  {/* TODO: Add ability to view full size images. */}
  <Image
    src={oldSiteSmall}
    alt="Old site design"
    style="width: 100%; height: auto; border: solid 1px #0e0e0e; border-radius: 4px;"
  />
  <Image
    src={newSiteSmall}
    alt="New site design"
    style="width: 100%; height: auto; border: solid 1px #0e0e0e; border-radius: 4px;"
  />
</div>

Key changes include:

- New writing section for blog posts, with an RSS feed
- Smaller hero section focused on my interests
- Updated color scheme and shift to standard browser fonts
- Simpler design with fewer images and animations
- Updated and accurate work history

## Astro's take on static site generation

Beneath the surface, [the codebase](https://github.com/jwngr/jwn.gr) underwent a complete
overhaul. Stuck on an outdated Gatsby 1.x version, a full rewrite became the path of least
resistance.

My experience with Gatsby's older version was fraught with complex data fetching, sluggish
builds, and challenging upgrades. While Gatsby has evolved, Astro emerged as a fresh alternative,
ultimately offering a smoother developer experience and enhanced site performance.

Both Gatsby and Astro are static site generators (SSGs), meaning they generate HTML at build
time which is then shipped to the browser. This is ideal for portfolio and blog sites like mine
which have little dynamic content and want to optimize for search engine indexing.

Where Gatsby and Astro differ is in how they handle rendering and interactivity:

- **Gatsby** generates static HTML at build time, then hydrates into a Single Page Application
  (SPA) using React, with navigations being handled in JavaScript.
- **Astro** is designed as a Multi-Page Application (MPA) by default, shipping minimal
  JavaScript and delivering static HTML via full page reloads.

Astro delivers faster page loads and better SEO out-of-the-box, while offering flexibility
through [Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) for interactivity and optional
server-side rendering. For my primarily static site, Astro's approach is a perfect fit,
eliminating the unnecessary overhead of a full SPA or React-powered solution.

## Where Astro shines

Astro does a lot right. Here's what stood out to me during the migration:

- **Component-based design:** Astro's [component architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/)
  brings one of React's largest benefits without the dependency. It has some limitations covered
  below, but the abstraction feels very familiar.
- **Simplified data handling:** Astro's approach to data fetching feels like a return to basics.
  No more GraphQL queries everywhere — just straightforward data access using `import` and `await`.
  [Content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) provide a clean,
  type-safe API for my blog with minimal code.
- **TypeScript support:** Astro's extensive [TypeScript support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/)
  provides peace of mind and speeds up development.
- **Simple, well-designed integrations:** Astro's [integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/)
  required less code and configuration than I remember from Gatsby. I easily added an RSS feed,
  sitemap, and MDX support for the blog.
- **Framework flexibility:** The ability to fall back to React (or other frameworks) when needed
  feels like the right trade-off, avoiding lock-in to Astro's ecosystem. I leveraged this for my
  [newsletter signup form](https://github.com/jwngr/jwn.gr/blob/master/src/components/blog/NewsletterSignupForm.tsx),
  which I didn't have time to migrate from React.
- **Thoughtful documentation:** The docs are extensive, well-organized, and even include a [guide on
  migrating from Gatsby](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/from-gatsby/).

## Challenges with Astro

The migration was not without hurdles:

1. **Conditional CSS:** Astro's approach required rethinking my styling strategy, making some
   tasks more tedious compared to using `styled-components`. Conditionally applying styles using
   classes and CSS, even with the help of `class:list`, required more code than I would like.
2. **Component conversion:** Moving from untyped React class components to `.astro` components
   with TypeScript was time-consuming but ultimately beneficial. I still have some hesitation with
   the proprietary file format, but it looks and behaves like TypeScript, JSX, and CSS.
3. **Lack of multiple exports from `.astro` files:** This limitation led to some code organization
   challenges. `FlexRow` and `FlexColumn` share a common
   [`Flex` component](https://github.com/jwngr/jwn.gr/blob/master/src/components/atoms/Flex.astro)
   that ideally would never be exported. Named exports are important for maintaining large
   codebases, and I would love to see support for this added to the format.

## The results

While metrics weren't a primary goal with the redesign, I'm quite happy with the final outcome.
Page loads come in at just a few 100 kB, load within a few 100 ms, and have nearly perfect Lighthouse
scores across the board:

<Image src={lighthouse} alt="Lighthouse scores for jwn.gr" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />

More importantly, I achieved my initial goals:

1. **Dedicated writing space:** Creating a blog post is now as simple as adding a `.mdx` file, and
   I'm able to fall back to React as needed for more interactive posts.
2. **Reduced maintenance:** Fewer dependencies, less code, and more confidence in future upgrades.
3. **Refreshed appearance:** The new design better represents my current skills and aesthetic
   preferences.

## Looking forward

My website has gone from a source of frustration to a canvas ready for sharing my work. It is
simultaneously simpler and more capable, which is always what I'm going for.

The best framework is the one that meets your current needs and brings joy to your development
process. Astro is doing that for me right now.
