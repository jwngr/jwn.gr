The card will contain a picture, as well as my step count and heart rate graph. Alongside the card, I'll also write a short post, just like this. The only restriction being that it can be no longer than 100 words. 100 words, like some weird Twitter. I'll talk about everything from what I did to who I met to what I learned. But that's all for today, as I'm running out of words. See you tomorrow!",

It was over the top gorgeous, a grandiose display of wealth consisting of meticulously-crafted marble sculptures, swimming pool-sized paintings, and an unreal quantity of gold. Although I enjoyed ogling everything inside the chateau, I spent most of my time walking around (and getting lost in) the extensive gardens. I made quick friends with some curious sheep and meditated in my most tranquil spot yet. A satisfying day to cap this leg of the trip.",

Today's visit was to Adhanur, the smallest of the bunch at only 38 students across 1st to 5th standards. To get baseline scores for students' English abilities, we administered a simple test used elsewhere across India. It showed only a single student comprehended English sentences and a surprising amount couldn't even name letters. Our after-school centers perform much more favorably, giving us hope we'll see improved results when we test these students again upon the conclusion of the school year.",

The result is a city brimming with quality dining options.",

A street vendor on Pub Street just outside our hotel which sold chicken fried rice for $1.50 accepted two greenbacks as payment. To add to the intrigue, the vendor didn't give back American change since Cambodia is a coinless society. Instead, they produced a 2,000 riel note, Cambodia's local currency which is much weaker than the dollar. It's strange to use American money in such a foreign land, but I do appreciate the short break from the mental overhead of constantly converting currencies.",

Moss-covered chapels depicting life-sized Stations of the Cross lined its lower staircase. Its main upper staircase featured sculptures and fountains dedicated to the five senses, zigzagging up to a Baroque church containing a detailed altar scene of Jesus' crucifixion. History and meaning permeated the grounds, making the sanctuary feel like a plot point straight out of a Dan Brown novel.",
